# Living Skyrim

This is a mini project based on this Skyrim perk calculator https://chrizel.github.io/skyrim/, made by Christian Zeller. All credit for the code goes to him, i merely modified the data.js file to fit the new perks, as well as some slight modifications in app.js to make it display everything properly. This does not include the function to create a script to give you all the perks, as the FormIDs of the perks change based on your load order, thus it would be different for everyone.
